# JIRA Python Library

This library eases the use of the JIRA REST API from Python applications.

# Quickstart

Feeling impatient? I like your style.

    :::python
        from jira.client import JIRA

        options = { 'server': 'https://jira.atlassian.com'}
        jira = JIRA(options)

        issue = jira.issue('JRA-9')
        print issue.fields.project.key             # 'JRA'
        print issue.fields.issuetype.name          # 'New Feature'
        print issue.fields.reporter.displayName    # 'Mike Cannon-Brookes [Atlassian]'

# Installation

Download and install using `pip install jira` or `easy_install jira`

You can also try `pip install --user --upgrade jira` which will install or upgrade jira to user directory 

You ARE using a [virtualenv][2], right?

# Usage

See the documentation (http://readthedocs.org/docs/jira-python/) for full details.
