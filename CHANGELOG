  from d5856742771890ad18165197f6bc7eb3ff8cd086. The oauth_dance and
  print_tokens options specified in jirashell.ini configuration file are
  now correctly parsed as boolean values and OAuth with pre-
  authenticated access_token and access_token_secret (skipping
  oauth_dance) is fixed. OAuth options are now minimally validated for
  completeness, so #66 is fixed, allowing for basic_auth without causing
  issue #102 as the merged commit
  d5856742771890ad18165197f6bc7eb3ff8cd086 did previously. [Milo
  Minderbinder]

- Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' [Milo Minderbinder]

- Fix issue #100 - The problem is that 'oauth_dance' should be an
  optional option argument, if it is not set, or if it is set to false,
  a valid use case still exists where OAuth should be used if the user
  supplies access_token and access_token_secret through command line or
  configuration file options. This would be the case if the user had
  already authenticated externally with OAuth and had valid,
  authenticated tokens to pass to jirashell. [Milo Minderbinder]
