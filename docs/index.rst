This documents the ``jira-python`` package (version |release|), a Python library designed to ease the use of the
JIRA REST API. Some basic support for the GreenHopper REST API also exists.

The source is stored at https://github.com/pycontribs/jira.

Until someone will find a better way to generate the release notes you can read
https://github.com/pycontribs/jira/blob/master/CHANGELOG which is generated based on git commit messages.
